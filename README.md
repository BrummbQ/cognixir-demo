# CognixirDemo

**Demo application for the cognitive services library [Cognixir](https://github.com/BrummbQ/cognixir)**

Basically this app takes preferably images and analyzes them with the Computer Vision Api. It tries to tell you if the item on the image is edible and suggests a menu name. Just try it out and have some fun!

## Usage

Check out this repository and install all required dependencies with hex. You should also obtain the api keys from your azure account and create a `test.exs` file (an example config is provided). Then you can run `mix test` to see some examples. It should output a html file in `/output`
